Fixa E2E Test Suite
This repository contains automated end-to-end tests for the Fixa Employee Management System, built using Playwright and TypeScript.

The suite is designed to validate core workflows such as authentication and partial employee onboarding. Onboarding coverage is partial due to limited time available for setup and test implementation.

🔐 Authentication Coverage
Authentication flows are located in tests/auth/:

login.spec.ts: Valid login with correct credentials

invalid-login.spec.ts: Invalid login and error handling

Credentials used for staging:

Email: wouldhavelovedtousegithubsecrets@fixing.com

Password: nottoberevealed

These credentials are for testing purposes only. Do not use in production.

👥 Employee Dashboard Coverage
Employee-related tests are located in tests/employees/:

add-employee.spec.ts: Adds a new employee manually via the onboarding flow

Includes form validation, gender selection, and submission logic

Uses mock API responses for consistency

🕒 CI Integration
To run tests daily via GitHub Actions, use the workflow defined in:

bash
.github/workflows/playwright-daily.yml
This workflow runs the full suite every day at 8:00 AM UTC and uploads the Playwright report as an artifact.
